== Intro == 10s

Our hack is an attempt at expanding our minds through intelligence augmentation.
it is a smart mind map where the user expanding our knowledge horizon, It feels like having a super power.

== Demo == 1:20 min

A physics engine to represent information in a fun and intuitive environment.

We used IBM Watson's language processing and deep learning capabilities to generate ideas that integrates into our own mind map. 

We used Wit.AI

Finally, we used a Knowledge Graph API to visualize public data.

<!-- Meteor.js, IBM Watson, Graphiq api, Voice Recognition -->

== Ending == 15s

Traditional mindmap is a great tool to brainstorm and write down things that you already know.
But with our smart mind map, it BUILDS UPON what you know, and expands it with the collective intelligence.

What we have accomplished in our hack, is just a glimpse of a future where AI empowers us to think better. Hope you like it. 

Thank you.
